## Ideas

    - Make beautiful background
    - Replace orbs with apples
    - Be able to take out sword and slash apples
  - https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/tiny-swords
- Introduce scrolling for a bigger world. 
- Seamless movement instead of tile-based movement (may be too big for this project)
- Replace rendering to WebGL.
